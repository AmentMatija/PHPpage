			<h2>"Not Disneyland": Dutch hit back at "over-tourism"</h2>
			<p class="description">Two tourist coaches career along the narrow winding road past a human-sized yellow clog. Bus after bus queues to drop off its eager passengers, creating tailbacks down the rolling dykes as far as the eye can see.</p>
			<p>Nineteen windmills occupy the village of Kinderdijk near Rotterdam. A quintessential structure of Dutch iconography, this is one of the most photographed destinations in the Netherlands.</p>
			<p>Filing out into the misty rain, the tourists pop open their scarlet umbrellas expectantly and a tour guide brandishes a red marker sign in the drizzle, explaining the significance of this unique Unesco-recognised site.</p>
			<p>Constituting a masterpiece in water management, the mills once drained the water from the land, preventing flooding since around 1740.</p>
			<p>But this is not a museum, the mills are full of life. And some residents who live in the mills have had enough. They have created postcards inviting the tourists to consider the impact of their visits.</p>
			<p>"I have many, many bad experiences with the tourists," says Johan Velthuizen, a 56-year-old robot programmer. He lived in Kinderdijk his whole life and runs the "liveability" local action group thats been petitioning the mayor to better manage the mass tourism.</p>
			<p>"They run through my garden with their whole families. Were sitting drinking tea in the sunshine, then we look up and theres a Chinese family trampling through my flowers.</p>
			<p>"To start with it was just tourists from the US or the UK, now its China and Japan. They have so many millions of people, they all want to come to have their photo with a windmill."</p>
