			<h2>Could these beautiful islands help stop killer diseases?</h2>
			<p class="description">Travellers to the remote African islands of Bijagos can expect to find a tropical paradise of pristine beaches and lush rainforest.</p>
			<p>But the islands are not just beautiful. They are also a natural laboratory, providing a unique setting in which to study cures for some of the worlds deadliest diseases.</p>
			<p>A collection of 18 islands and 70 islets off the coast of Guinea-Bissau, West Africa, the Bijagos are home to about 30,000 people with their own language and unique traditions.</p>
			<p>They also teem with wildlife, including the rare saltwater hippopotamus and giant sea turtle, which thrive in this remote spot.</p>
			<p>But these tranquil islands are home to many serious illnesses and conditions. Life expectancy on Guinea-Bissau is about 60, and on the Bijagos Islands it is thought to be much lower.</p>
			<p>Malaria, a severe eye infection called trachoma, lymphatic filariasis - a chronic swelling sometimes known as elephantiasis - and intestinal worms are particular problems.</p>
			<p>However, the islands may also hold the secret to tackling the very diseases that blight them.</p>
			<p>Medical researchers have been working on the Bijagos Islands for several years to see if they can get rid of certain diseases from certain islands.</p>
			<p>The islands separation by water creates a natural barrier. This allows us to compare different disease control methods, without the risk of cross-contamination between the test sites.</p>
