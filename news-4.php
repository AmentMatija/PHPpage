			<h2>Thousands flee as Guatemalas Fuego volcano erupts</h2>
			<p class="description">The stratovolcano southwest of the city of Antigua began erupting on Sunday, with ash and lava spewing from its crater.</p>
			<p>It comes five months after almost 200 people were buried by volcanic ash and mud during a violent eruption in June. </p>
			<p>That eruption generated pyroclastic flows - fast-moving mixtures of very hot gas and volcanic matter - which descended down the slopes, engulfing communities such as El Rodeo and San Miguel Los Lotes.</p>
			<p>Volcanologists say lava is rising 500m above the volcanos crater.</p>
			<p>The ash cloud exceeds a height of 1km (3,280ft) above the 3,763m-tall (12,250ft) volcano.</p>
			<p>Fuego is one of Latin America most active volcanoes.</p>
