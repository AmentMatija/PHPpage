		<p>The World Wide Web (WWW), also called the Web, is an information space where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), interlinked by hypertext links, and accessible via the Internet.</p>
		<p>English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989.</p>
		<p>He wrote the first web browser in 1990 while employed at CERN near Geneva, Switzerland.</p>
		<p>In 1984, Berners Lee returned to CERN, which was also home to a major European Internet node. In 1989, Berners Lee published a paper called "Information Management: A Proposal" in which he married up hypertext with the Internet, to create a system for sharing and distributing information not just within a company, but globally. He named it the World Wide Web.</p>
		<p>He also created the first web browser and editor. The worlds first website, http://info.cern.ch, was launched on 6 August 1991. It explained the World Wide Web concept and gave users an introduction to getting started with their own websites.</p>
		<p>In 1994, Berners Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Laboratory of Computer Science (LCS) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston. He has served as director of the consortium since then. He also works as a senior research scientist at LCS which has now become the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.</p>
