			<h2>Israel Defence Minister Lieberman resigns over Gaza ceasefire</h2>
			<p class="description">Israel defence minister has resigned over the cabinets decision to accept a ceasefire ending two days of fighting with Palestinian militants in Gaza.</p>
			<p>Avigdor Lieberman denounced the move as "surrendering to terror". He said his right-wing Yisrael Beiteinu party would leave the ruling coalition, which could lead to an early election.</p>
			
			<p>Eight people were killed on Monday and Tuesday as militants fired 460 rockets towards Israel and Israeli forces bombed 160 targets in Gaza.</p>
			<p>The ceasefire was largely holding on Wednesday and schools and businesses in southern Israel reopened after no rocket attacks were reported overnight.</p>
			<p>However, Israels military said it had shot at and captured a Palestinian man who tried to breach the Israel-Gaza border fence while hurling grenades..</p>
			<p>Palestinian health officials later said a fisherman had been killed by Israeli fire in northern Gaza. The Israeli military said soldiers had shot the man because he was advancing towards the border fence.</p>
